# HCText2Image

Train a toy autoregressive image generator and VQ codes.

I ran this for a few weeks on my [laion-icons](https://github.com/unixpickle/laion-icons) dataset. Here are some samples for the prompts:

 1. a red heart icon, red heart vector graphic
 2. a green tree, a tree with green leaves
 3. A blue square. A simple blue square icon.
 4. a cute corgi vector graphic. corgi dog graphic

Clearly the model has learned something, although it's not particularly good for most prompts.
